# Roadmap

## V2 Focus (Short List)
- Per-title refresh + cached results to speed up the dashboard.
- Availability dedupe per book+library to eliminate duplicate badges.
- Better matching (ISBN/ASIN first, fuzzy title+author fallback).
- Libby handoff on each result for quick borrow/hold.

## Nice-to-Have
- User accounts and saved library profiles.
- Notifications for availability changes.
- Background jobs for periodic sync.
